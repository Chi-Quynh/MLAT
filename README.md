## Introduction:
A digital flashcard software that helps users learn language and create new flashcards using machine learning (OCR)

|Subject|Details|
|-----:|---------------|
|Deliverable|Project that focuses on OCR Word Recognition and User Experience|
|Developer Goal|Learn about machine learning, documentation, software architecture and database|
|Scope|This project entails machine learning, .NET software development, SQL Database and documentation in a span of 3-4 months|
	
## Functions:
- Taking picture: users can take pictures of unfamiliar words or images to assist learning
- Image to word recognition: The ML image to word should have a recognition rate of 90% with a wait time of 2s
- Word to dictionary definition: The dictionary should be installed at the start and automatically triggered upon successful scan of a word
- Storing flashcards: Flashcards stored extensible for future implementation such as Cloud

## Timeline: Agile-based workflow
|Phase | Action item |
|-----:|---------------|
|Initial planning|Planning and getting insight for project               |
| Learning|Learn the basis of software and ML foundations from books, courses               |
| Designing | Design all the necessary elements before developing |
| Prototype|  Finish initial software, ML model and interface to demonstrate product |            |
|Testing|Testing software and ML for technical requirements, if fail go back to learning / design phase |
|Demo|Finish software and launch for open source |
