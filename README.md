Introduction:
A digital flashcard software on .NET that uses ML (OCR) to recognize image to word. It is a language learning tool for the immersion phase (reading comic, novel, watching film w English subtitles)
Goal and scope:
Goal	Build a program that is usable (technical), practical (UX) and also supports other units in school
Scope
	1 to 3 people to assist the code and interface. Open source for people to use.
Learning outcome:
Documentation, Math (ML), Machine Learning, C#
Functions:
o	Taking picture: users can take pictures of unfamiliar words or images to assist learning
o	Image to word recognition: The ML image to word should have a recognition rate of 90% with a wait time of 2s
o	Word to dictionary definition: The dictionary should be installed at the start and automatically triggered upon successful scan of a word
o	Storing flashcards: Flashcards stored securely and extensible for future implementation such as Cloud
UX requirements:
o	The program should be able to be on the background like Discord
o	The user should be able to easily use the snapshot function of the program from the background with a button
o	Flashcard should be fun, flexible (different fonts, size, ease of use)
Technical requirements:
o	The program should be able to ran on MacOS, Windows
o	Security: ensures data are stored securely
o	Accessibility: the interface should be clear to see for people with disability (color blindness)
o	Performance: Loads times to exceed only 2 seconds
Estimated time:
One semester from start of Sep HE sem to start of Jan HE sem
Timeline: Agile-based workflow
Initial planning	Planning and getting insight for project
Learning	Learn the basis of software and ML foundations from books, courses
Prototype	Finish initial software, ML model and interface to demonstrate product
Test for bugs	Testing software and ML for technical requirements 
Review and rehearse	Get peer-review and feedback from professors
Demo	Finish software and launch for audience feedback
Project unknowns:
o	It is unknown where the program will store the database
o	Timeline has high unpredictability because lack of experience in projects (time taken and workflow)
o	Time will be allocated to learning Math to build solid ML learning foundations
